<p><b>Undergrad</b>: Université de Montréal - Archambault lab - Institute for Research in Cancer and Immunology</p>
<p><b>Grad school</b>: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - Maddox lab - Biology department</p>

<p>As a graduate student in the Maddox lab at UNC Chapel Hill, I've been asking the simple question of how a nucleus comes to be a functional organelle within the cell. This is a fundamental process as every cell must form a new nucleus following cell division and condensed sperm chromatin must expand into a functional pronucleus following fertilization across organisms. We've been using mathematical modelling, several model organisms (mammalian cells, fly embryos, worm embryos, frog egg extracts) and quantitative live-cell microscopy approaches (tracking, morphological analyses, fluorescence intensity quantifications, etc) to determine the molecular requirements of nuclear expansion and assembly.
Mostly though, being able to collaborate with several students, post-docs and labs from all walks of life on image analysis problems has been incredibly rewarding. Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate!</p>

<p>What I'm looking to do.</p>
