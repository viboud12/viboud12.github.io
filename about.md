<p><b>CarbonDrop - Director of Scientific Research</b></p>
<p>CarbonDrop, founded by a combination of Silicon Valley veterans and genetic engineers, is the most ambitious carbon sequestration company conceived to date, and our aim is to put a serious dent in the climate problems afflicting the planet.</p>
<p>The company’s goal is to sequester tens of gigatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, and thus turn the clock back on global warming. Moreover, given the scalability of the biological innovations we intend to develop, we believe we can accomplish this at a cost per tonne that is radically lower than the achievable targets of the other known carbon dioxide removal companies operating today.</p>
<p>In summary, our goal is to remove more CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere each year than is currently being emitted, and to do this at a cost per tonne of less than $5.00, which is more than an order of magnitude lower than competing proposals.</p>
<p><b>Postdoc</b> (joint appointment)</p>
<p>University of California, Berkeley - <a href="https://niyogilab.berkeley.edu/">Niyogi lab</a> - Plant and Microbial Biology Department</p>
<p>University of California, San Francisco - <a href="https://cellgeometry.ucsf.edu/">Marshall lab</a> - Center for Cellular Construction</p>
<p>As a joint postdoc between the Marshall (UCSF) and Niyogi (UCB) labs, I was interested in photosynthetic efficiency in the context of algal endosymbiosis. I used bioenergetic, molecular and light microscopy approaches to address <b>how hosts regulate their algal symbionts, how this regulation affects algal metabolism and how algal endosymbionts in turn regulate their hosts</b>. This work was inspired by observations of the symbiotic relationship in the wild ciliate <i>Stentor pyriformis</i> in the context of <b>the Physiology course hosted by the Marine Biological Laboratory</b> in Woods Hole, MA.</p>
<p><b>Grad school</b></p>
<p>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - <a href="http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Maddox/Site/Welcome.html">Maddox lab</a> - Biology Department</p>
<p>As a graduate student in the Maddox lab at UNC Chapel Hill, I addressed how a nucleus comes to be a functional organelle within the cell. This is an essential process as every cell must form a new nucleus following cell division and condensed sperm chromatin must expand into a functional pronucleus following fertilization across organisms. We used a combination of <b>mathematical modelling</b>, <b>several model organisms</b> (mammalian cells, fly embryos, worm embryos, frog egg extracts) and <b>quantitative live-cell microscopy approaches</b> (tracking, morphological analyses, fluorescence intensity quantifications, etc) to determine the molecular requirements of nuclear expansion and assembly.</p>
