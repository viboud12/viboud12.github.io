<p><b>Undergrad</b>: Université de Montréal - Archambault lab - Institute for Research in Cancer and Immunology</p>
<p><b>Grad school</b>: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill - Maddox lab - Biology department</p>

<h4>Current</h4>
<p>As a graduate student in the Maddox lab at UNC Chapel Hill, I've been asking the fundamental question of how a nucleus comes to be a functional organelle within the cell. This is an essential process as every cell must form a new nucleus following cell division and condensed sperm chromatin must expand into a functional pronucleus following fertilization across organisms. We've been using <b>mathematical modelling</b>, <b>several model organisms</b> (mammalian cells, fly embryos, worm embryos, frog egg extracts) and <b>quantitative live-cell microscopy approaches</b> (tracking, morphological analyses, fluorescence intensity quantifications, etc) to determine the molecular requirements of nuclear expansion and assembly.
Mostly though, being able to collaborate with several students, post-docs and labs from all walks of life on image analysis problems has been incredibly rewarding. <b>Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to collaborate!</b></p>

<h4>Future</h4>
<p>Once I get my degree (someday?), I'll be shifting my focus to work on algal symbiosis and metabolism to address <b>how hosts regulate their algal symbionts, how this regulation affects algal metabolism and how algal endosymbionts in turn regulate their hosts</b>. This work is inspired by our observations of the symbiotic relationship in the wild ciliate <i>Stentor pyriformis</i> under the supervision of Wallace Marshall (UCSF) in the context of <b>the Physiology course hosted by the Marine Biological Laboratory</b> in Woods Hole, MA.</p>
