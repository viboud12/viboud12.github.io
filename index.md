As a joint postdoc between the labs of Kris Niyogi (UC Berkeley) and Wallace Marshall (UC San Francisco), I am developing a cell biological model of algal endosymbiosis using the freshwater protist <i>Stentor pyriformis</i>. With genomics, phylogenetics, microscopy and quantitative image analysis, I am developing tools to uncover how algal endosymbionts influence their host's behavior, and how host's regulate function of their endosymbionts. We're happy to be supported by a Symbiosis Model Systems (SMS) grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and thank them for their support.
