In working to understand how the nucleus becomes a functional organelle within the cell and how nuclear biology is regulated through mitosis, I've developed several <b>image analysis</b> tools to make quantitive measurements. I've also had the opportunity to collaborate with several labs (<b>Fachinetti lab</b> - Insitut Curie, <b>Canman lab</b> - Columbia University, <b>Peifer + Slep + Sekelsky labs</b> - UNC Chapel Hill) and have developed a wide range of analysis tools, many of which are available <a> href="analysis.html">here</a>. Please <b>contact me</b> for more information regarding the plugins I've made available through GitHub or if you think I can be helpful with your own projects!
