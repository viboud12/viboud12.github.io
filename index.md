As a biologist, I use contemporary molecular and biophysical tools to answer fundamental algal bioenergetic questions and apply findings to the development of climate change abatement technologies. In my role as Director of Scientific Research at CarbonDrop, we are developing scalable CO<sub>2</sub> removal technologies to put a serious dent in the climate change problems afflicting our planet. Previously, I have had the pleasure of working with amazing colleagues at UC Berkeley, UC San Francisco, the Marine Biological Laboratory and in particular the Physiology Course, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Montreal.
